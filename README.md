# password-generator

The goal of this project was to create a program that would generate a random password comprised of a combination of integers and characters, including upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. When the user clicks the 'Generate Password' button, they are asked a series of qualifying questions through prompt windows that determine the user's preferences for character length, upper and lowercase letters, etc. The password is then displayed in on the page.

The remote repository for the project can be found at: github.com/pwkinsley87/password-generator
